# FIR_FILTER
FIR Filter (64-Tap) Project using Verilog HDL

Hello! 🙏
This repository contains my Summer Internship project: a "64-Tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter", designed fully using Verilog HDL and simulated in Xilinx Vivado 2025.1.

📌 About the Project

This project implements a low-pass FIR filter with fixed symmetric coefficients (Q1.15 format). The main objective is to filter out high-frequency noise from real-world signals like voice, audio, or biomedical data. It follows a shift-register + multiply + accumulate architecture and supports up to 64 input samples.

🧠 My Learnings

I completed this during my MeitY C2S Internship on VLSI Design at VR Siddhartha Engineering College, and I also had exposure to tools like Synopsys Design Compiler, ICC2, and Verdi, along with MATLAB Simulink (Model Composer). But here, everything is fully built using pure Verilog, line by line.

⚙️ Modules Included

All modules were handwritten and tested in simulation:

Module	Description
fir_filter.v	Top FIR filter module with 64 taps
dff_16bit.v	16-bit D flip-flop for input shift registers
mul_16bit.v	16-bit signed multiplier (partial product style)
rca_32bit.v	32-bit Ripple Carry Adder used for accumulation
tb_fir_filter.v	Full testbench with simulation results
All internal signals and arithmetic operations are signed to support both positive and negative data.
