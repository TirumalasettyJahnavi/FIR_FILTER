# FIR_FILTER
FIR Filter (64-Tap) Project using Verilog HDL

Hello! üôè
This repository contains my Summer Internship project: a "64-Tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter", designed fully using Verilog HDL and simulated in Xilinx Vivado 2025.1.

üìå About the Project

This project implements a low-pass FIR filter with fixed symmetric coefficients (Q1.15 format). The main objective is to filter out high-frequency noise from real-world signals like voice, audio, or biomedical data. It follows a shift-register + multiply + accumulate architecture and supports up to 64 input samples.

üß† My Learnings

I completed this during my MeitY C2S Internship on VLSI Design at VR Siddhartha Engineering College, and I also had exposure to tools like Synopsys Design Compiler, ICC2, and Verdi, along with MATLAB Simulink (Model Composer). But here, everything is fully built using pure Verilog, line by line.

‚öôÔ∏è Modules Included

All modules were handwritten and tested in simulation:

Module	Description
fir_filter.v	Top FIR filter module with 64 taps
dff_16bit.v	16-bit D flip-flop for input shift registers
mul_16bit.v	16-bit signed multiplier (partial product style)
rca_32bit.v	32-bit Ripple Carry Adder used for accumulation
tb_fir_filter.v	Full testbench with simulation results
All internal signals and arithmetic operations are signed to support both positive and negative data.
